Writing good comments in Python is essential for making your code readable, maintainable, and easy to understand for others (and even for yourself in the future). Here are some good practices for commenting Python code, followed by an example demonstrating those practices.


### Key Points:

1. **Docstrings** are used to document the purpose and behavior of classes, functions, and methods.
2. **Inline comments** clarify small parts of complex logic.
3. **Block comments** explain larger chunks of code or logic flow.
4. Avoid over-commenting obvious code, and always update your comments if the code changes.
5. Use `TODO` or `FIXME` to highlight parts that need improvement or attention.

This approach keeps your codebase clean, maintainable, and easy to understand for yourself and others.
### 1. **Use Docstrings for Functions and Classes**
   - **Docstrings** provide a way to document your functions, methods, and classes. They explain the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the function or class.
   - Place docstrings directly under the function or class definition.

   **Good Practice:**
   - Mention the functionâ€™s purpose.
   - Explain input arguments and their types.
   - Explain the return value and its type.

   ```python
   def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
       """
       Adds two numbers together.

       Parameters:
           a (int): The first number.
           b (int): The second number.

       Returns:
           int: The sum of the two numbers.
       """
       return a + b
   ```

### 2. **Inline Comments for Clarifying Complex Code**
   - Use inline comments sparingly to clarify complex code or logic. Place the comment on the same line, after the code.
   - Keep inline comments short and to the point.

   ```python
   result = a * b  # Multiplying a and b to get the result
   ```

### 3. **Block Comments for Explaining Sections of Code**
   - Use block comments to explain a block of code or complex logic that may not be obvious. Place these comments above the code.
   - Make sure the comments are concise but descriptive enough to explain the logic or process.

   ```python
   # Calculate the sum of all elements in the list
   # We loop through each element and add it to the total
   total_sum = 0
   for num in numbers:
       total_sum += num
   ```

### 4. **Avoid Obvious or Redundant Comments**
   - Don't add comments that simply state what the code does when it's already obvious.
   - Avoid comments that explain trivial code, such as assignments or simple operations.

   ```python
   # Bad comment: too obvious
   count = 0  # Set count to zero

   # Good comment: clarifying purpose
   count = 0  # Initialize counter for tracking iterations
   ```

### 5. **Keep Comments Up-to-Date**
   - As you modify your code, ensure that comments remain accurate and relevant. Outdated comments can be misleading.
   - Regularly review your comments to make sure they still align with the code's functionality.

### 6. **Comment TODOs and Fixmes**
   - If you need to handle something later or fix an issue, use `TODO` or `FIXME` comments to mark those spots in the code. This is a common practice to highlight areas that need attention in the future.

   ```python
   # TODO: Refactor this function to improve efficiency
   ```

### 7. **Use Consistent Style and Formatting**
   - Use consistent language and formatting throughout your codebase.
   - Ensure comments are properly formatted with appropriate capitalization, punctuation, and spacing.

### Example of Well-Commented Python Code

```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.
    """

    def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """
        Adds two numbers together.

        Parameters:
            a (int): The first number.
            b (int): The second number.

        Returns:
            int: The sum of the two numbers.
        """
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """
        Subtracts the second number from the first.

        Parameters:
            a (int): The number to be subtracted from.
            b (int): The number to subtract.

        Returns:
            int: The result of the subtraction.
        """
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """
        Multiplies two numbers.

        Parameters:
            a (int): The first number.
            b (int): The second number.

        Returns:
            int: The product of the two numbers.
        """
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a: int, b: int) -> float:
        """
        Divides the first number by the second.

        Parameters:
            a (int): The dividend.
            b (int): The divisor.

        Returns:
            float: The result of the division.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the divisor is zero.
        """
        if b == 0:
            # Guard against division by zero
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    calc = Calculator()
    
    # Perform some calculations
    sum_result = calc.add(10, 5)  # Adds 10 and 5
    print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")

    # TODO: Implement additional operations like modulus and exponentiation
```
